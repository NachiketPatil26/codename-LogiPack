# Container Load Optimizer Improvements Tracking

This file tracks the progress of the 20 planned improvements to the Container Load Optimizer application.




- [ ] **7. Loading Animation**
  - [ ] Add a more engaging loading animation during optimization
  - [ ] Show progressive loading of items in the 3D view

## Functional Improvements


- [ ] **10. Constraint-Based Packing**
  - [ ] Add support for item-specific constraints (e.g., "this box must be on top")
  - [ ] Allow specifying load-bearing capacity for fragile items

- [ ] **11. Weight Distribution Analysis**
  - [ ] Add visual indicators for weight distribution
  - [ ] Implement warnings for unbalanced loading

- [ ] **12. Export Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add more export formats (e.g., CSV for item positions)
  - [ ] Improve PDF reports with more detailed packing instructions
  - [ ] Add ability to export/import configurations as JSON

## Algorithm Improvements

- [ ] **13. Optimization Strategies**
  - [ ] Add user-selectable packing strategies (e.g., prioritize weight vs. volume)
  - [ ] Implement genetic algorithms for better space utilization

- [ ] **14. Real-time Packing Preview**
  - [ ] Show a simplified preview of packing while the algorithm runs
  - [ ] Allow pausing and adjusting the algorithm mid-run

- [ ] **15. Multi-threading Improvements**
  - [ ] Better utilize web workers for parallel processing
  - [ ] Add progress reporting during optimization


## Performance Improvements

- [ ] **19. Algorithm Efficiency**
  - [ ] Optimize the packing algorithm for better performance with large item sets
  - [ ] Implement spatial partitioning for faster collision detection

- [ ] **20. 3D Rendering Optimization**
  - [ ] Add level-of-detail rendering for better performance with many items
  - [ ] Optimize shader usage for better mobile performance
